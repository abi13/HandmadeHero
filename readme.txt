GAME CONTROLS
-----
currently only keyboard is supported, but there is some gamepad-to-keyboard mapping logic

arrow up:    mapped to gamepad up button (move image up)
arrow down:  mapped to gamepad down button (move image down)
arrow left:  mapped to gamepad left button (move image left)
arrow right: mapped to gamepad right button (move image right)
key Q:       mapped to gamepad left shoulder (increase tone frequency)
key E:       mapped to gamepad right shoulder (decrease tone frequency)
