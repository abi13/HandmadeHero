1) Implement code to handle XBox controller in Java (f.e. use JXInput library)
  
  
How to do this in Windows:
  this technology is called XInput
  once per frame call XInputGetState() for every attached controller
  dynamically call a library 
  
code for controller:
  XInput returns value of sticks in the range [-32768..32767]
  in the game we normalize it to be in the range [-1..1]
