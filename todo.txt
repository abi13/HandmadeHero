1) Implement code to handle XBox controller in Java (f.e. use JXInput library)
  
  
How to do this in Windows:
  this technology is called XInput
  once per frame call XInputGetState() for every attached controller
  dynamically call a library 
  
code for controller:
  XInput returns value of sticks in the range [-32768..32767]
  in the game we normalize it to be in the range [-1..1]  
  dead-zone processing: XInput defines XINPUT_GAMEPAD_LEFT_THUMB_DEADZONE
     and XINPUT_GAMEPAD_RIGHT_THUMB_DEADZONE, which happen to be 20% + of the stick value!!!
    stick values that fall into a dead zone are to be ignored and their value must be set to 0
    GameControllerInput.stickAverageX and .stickAverageY are set by reading from controller
      state and adjusting by taking into account the dead zone
    then if stickAverageX or stickAverageY is greater than a threshold (say 0.5f)
      then convert it into one of move events: left, right, up, down
