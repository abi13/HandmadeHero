Day 002: opening a window
  https://forums.handmadehero.org/jace/videos/win32-platform/day002.html
  - window content is alternating between white and black, when sizing it
  
Day 003: allocating a back buffer
  https://forums.handmadehero.org/jace/videos/win32-platform/day003.html
  - close the app when close button is clicked
  - handle event: window size changed
  - create bitmap from scratch: 32-bit per pixel: RGB + alpha

Day 004: animating the back buffer
  https://forums.handmadehero.org/jace/videos/win32-platform/day004.html
  - fill the entire back buffer with blue color
  - fill the entire back buffer with a weird gradient 256x256 pixels
    window resizing animates the weird gradient 
    
Day 005: Windows graphics review
  https://forums.handmadehero.org/jace/videos/win32-platform/day005.html
  - code refactoring: encapsulate back buffer related code
  - create fixed size back buffer 1280x760 pixels
  
Day 006: gamepad and keyboard input
  https://forums.handmadehero.org/jace/videos/win32-platform/day006.html
   (Win: discussed XInput API)
   (Win: discussed unresolved external symbols and dynamic dll loading
         by using LoadLibrary() and GetProcAddress())
  - setup key binding and handler for the 'Esc' key
  
Day 007: initializing DirectSound
  https://forums.handmadehero.org/jace/videos/win32-platform/day007.html
  (Win: discussed DirectSound API, primary and secondary buffers)
  - nowadays audio is 48kHz, we'll use 2 sec audio buffer, 2 channels, 16 bit per sample
    note: in a buffer you have 16 bit for LEFT channel, and 16-bit for RIGHT channel,
          so that makes 4 bytes, or 32-bit per one sound sample
  - game loop implemented to do continuous rendering of weird gradient 

Day 008: writing a square wave sound
  https://forums.handmadehero.org/jace/videos/win32-platform/day008.html
  (Win: discussed how to write a square wave to DirectSound)
  - generating square wave audio of given frequency (medium C tone) 

Day 009: variable pitch sine wave sound
  https://forums.handmadehero.org/jace/videos/win32-platform/day009.html
  - square waves are harsh, so sine waves will be used instead to generate smoother sound
  - fixed point and floating point arithmetic explained
  - floating point arithmetic will be simulated by integer arithmetic
  - implemented sine wave sound 
  - pressing arrow up increases tone frequency, pressing arrow down decreases
